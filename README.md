Task was to create a webapplication for a auction site.

Users could sign up and login with their account details

Users could switch language between English, Swedish and German.

Users could add auctions and create an opening bid and a buyout price. As well as pick a date for their experation date.

Users could bid on other auctions and would receive an email if they won an auction or someone bid higher than them.

An internal clock was set up using celery (Distributed Task Qeuer) to check when auctions were done.

When an auction was done the winner and seller would receive an email about their winnings.
